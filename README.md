# To Run
To run my web page, ensure you have Live Preview installed, 
then simply go to the debugging tab and select "Debug Website." 
Then, hit the big green arrow and a chrome window will appear 
hosted on a local server displaying this web page.

Alternatively, you can also navigate to the top right of VSCode
while in this directory and hit the "Open Preview" button.

# To Test
To test this web pages' JavaScript, ensure that NPM is installed
in this directory. Once installed, simply type "npm run test" in 
the terminal.

Note: because of this Lab's Task 6 Bullet point 5, the test for 
printing Hello World to console may fail.
